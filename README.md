# Deadwood
By Edward Thompson and Gabriel Huffman

There is a make file among the files of the Zip, simply type make into the terminal where the .java files are and the program should compile. Will accept an argument from the terminal for how many players it should run (optimized for 2 or 3). Automatically will enter the first turn unless the argument was off, in which case you must specify amount of players before game starts.
